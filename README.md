# **Getting Ready for Physics Class**

You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

<br> 

# **Tasks**

<br>


### **Turn up the Temperature**

#### **1. Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius**
 

<br>

#### **2. Let’s test your function with a value of 100 Fahrenheit**

Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.


<br>

#### **3. Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit**

```
Temp (F) = Temp (C) * (9/5) + 32
 ```
<br>

#### **4. Let’s test your function with a value of 0 Celsius**

Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the value of c_to_f with 0 as an input.

<br>

## **Use the Force**

#### **5. Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration**

<br>

#### **6. Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration**

Save the result to a variable called train_force and print it out.

train_mass and train_acceleration have been defined for you at the top of script.py. Make sure to uncomment those lines before trying to use these variables.

<br>

#### **7. Print the string “The GE train supplies X Newtons of force.”, with X replaced by train_force**

<br>

#### **8. Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c**

c is a constant that is usually set to the speed of light, which is roughly 3 x 10^8. Set c to have a default value of 3*10**8.

get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared.

<br>

#### **9. Test get_energy by using it on bomb_mass, with the default value of c. Save the result to a variable called bomb_energy**

bomb_mass has been defined for you at the top of script.py. Make sure to uncomment this line before trying to use bomb_mass.

<br>

#### **10. Print the string “A 1kg bomb supplies X Joules.”, with X replaced by bomb_energy**

<br>

## **Do the Work**

#### **11. Define a final function called get_work that takes in mass, acceleration, and distance**

Work is defined as force multiplied by distance. First, get the force using get_force, then multiply that by distance. Return the result.

<br>

#### **12. Test get_work by using it on train_mass, train_acceleration, and train_distance. Save the result to a variable called train_work**

<br>

#### **13. Print the string "The GE train does X Joules of work over Y meters.", with X replaced with train_work and Y replaced with train_distance**
